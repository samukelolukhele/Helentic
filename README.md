# Helentic E-commerce Demo Store

This is a demo e-commerce site built with React, TypeScript & Tailwind. It uses an object variable acting as a makeshift database. The cart component uses local storage to persist data over user sessions. The website design took inspiration from the site [Deplace Maison](https://web.archive.org/web/20220125034711/https://www.deplacemaison.com/)
